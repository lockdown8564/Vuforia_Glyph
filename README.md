# Vuforia_Glyph
Glyph assets for Vuforia

Used Vuforia Target Manager to create device database with Cuboid WxLxH=6x6x6.  Took picture of glyph face and then cropped to 426pix @ 72pix/in.  Uploaded same face for each side of cuboid. Downloaded database zip has glyph.dat and glyph.xml(multi-target grey and brown glyphs).
